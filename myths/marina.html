         Nestled in a distant corner of the Sirelean territory, Marina watched over her small village.
Her duty as protector was not one she took lightly, she guarded the portal to the other
realms with fierce determination. Her adopted family had protected the gateway that
connected the surface of Edolas to their subterranean capitol. When she wasn't guarding
she was training. When she wasn't training, she was guarding. It was a vicious,
regimented cycle, one that was constantly at odds with her deep desire for adventure,
but one she took pride in all the same.<br><br>
Marina continued her evening patrol, swimming with her staff in hand. It had been a quiet
day, like every day, but she knew that was not an excuse not to have vigilance. The
territory around the portal was particularly rural, surrounded by a kelp forest and not
much else. She knew the ins and outs of it like the back of her hand. The object of her
attention itself, the portal, was on the surface, resting on a stone outcropping and
surrounded by a coral structure. The glow of it, faint and ethereal, was one that offered
comfort. Her powers were always strongest near it, a constant reminder towards all the
possibilities the outside had to offer.<br><br>
She took a moment to take it in, the current embracing her body and guiding her forward.
Her patrol would end there, on the surface, staying until the bioluminescent moss glowed
with the moonlight and her partner came to relieve her of duty. Break taken she kicked up,
pulling away from the current and propelling towards the surface. The portals glow grew
steadily brighter as she got closer. She paused, blinking the light out of her eyes.
That...wasn’t...Normal. Brighter than usual. Marina frowned, her grip tightening on her
staff, as she surged towards the surface. Her skin prickled, itching like static over her
skin. It was the portal. Something or someone was activating it. The water seemed to
know it, strangely. The current seemed to still, but the kelp still shivered in the water in the
direction of the portal as if a force were attracting it, she felt it too. Before she could react,
the portal activated engulfing everything around. She used her water abilities to escape,
the portal was too strong, it kept pulling her closer to an unknown destination.<br><br>
She felt her powers surge, an underwater storm formed around her. Reaching into her
pocket, she produced a flare and set it off towards her village before being absorbed. She
didn’t know what she would find on the other side of the portal. But she knew she would
defend her people with her life.
