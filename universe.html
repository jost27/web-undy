               In the beginning, there was only emptiness. A void in existence without light or hope, everything seemed more like a perpetual nightmare. However, like all
nightmares, this one too came to an end when Light first appeared. It warmly contained all of creation within its luminous beauty. As a result, Light cast a shadow
of a Darkness powerful and full of longing. The Darkness was envious of the Light and sought to imitate everything as it attempted to grasp a fraction of glory
for itself. Frustrated with consistent failure, the Darkness vowed not to stop until it dimmed the power of the Light. And so it was that the Eternal War came into
being.
<br>
               <br>
Tempia emerged to care for the frail threads of time which began to bind reality together. Where the threads collided, Marah assumed control over the released
energy, reshaping them into the many forms of matter. Power blasted through all reaches of the universe and Voidrus rose from entropy to maintain the correct
balance. As twins, Azrail and Cael held each other in equilibrium. While Life expanded throughout the universe, together they kept harmony in life and death. From
within Life’s subconscious, Inanis rose as dreams came to be. Every corner of existence combined to form the Primordial Realm.
<br><br>
Abruptly, Cael had a vision of noble beings sentient and filled with his light; Anima he would call them. To imbue Life with Anima, he made small reservoirs full of
his divinity. This brought about conflict among the Twins, and the balance was disrupted.
<br><br>
Azrail became surly, devoid of anything that could be considered pleasant. He grew irrationally enraged at the creation of Anima, for he saw it as Cael expanding
his power over the universe and the other Ethereans. With the assistance of Voidrus and Inanis, Azrail focused his resentment and anger to give rise to his most
powerful demon.
<br><br>
Arawn he was named, and terrible was his likeness to behold. His purpose was unspoken; unbidden, he leapt to carry out the will of Azrail. Arawn harried the
newborn Anima relentlessly, driving them into terror before the advancing Darkness. Cael foresaw this abomination as the end of Life. In answer, Cael enlisted
Tempia and Marah to help him create a rival for such a monstrosity as Arawn, as well as a place to match Kraxus, the newly formed realm of Darkness. This
new period of the Eternal War became known as the Etherean Schism.
<br><br>
The coalition of Marah and Tempia with Cael resulted in the making of the Citadel and the creation of the Guardians, who rose to fight against Arawn and his
purpose of total corruption. Both sides clashed in what was dubbed the Siege of the Citadel. As the conflict came to a climax, reality shattered when The
Fissuring transpired.
<br><br>
The uncontrollable forces from the battle caused the Primordial Realm to become unstable and fissure into separate realms. Blood from the fallen Guardians
seeped through the cracks of reality, dispersing their magical energy throughout these realms in the form of Essentia Particles. When the chaos settled, the
Primordial Realm had divided; Life within each realm had quickly transformed under the influence of each god, creating a unique variety of appearances, genetic
identities, and environmental needs. Life bloomed and diversified into a full spectrum as a result of the renewed Eternal War.
<br><br>
In retaliation for the outcome, Azrail vowed to give rise to more Anima abominations of his own. Through Arawn, he commanded the demons to collect the
Anima inside Life within all newly-formed realms. During the growing threat to the Anima, each of the other realms fell under various Etherean domains.
<br><br>
Ovagon, the Realm of Haruspex, emerged from the frailty of fractured time with Tempia as its caretaker. Following the lead, Marah siphoned all environmental
energy from Algor, Realm of Borealis, and funneled it into Edolas. She pushed the Realm of Desolation into an opposite extreme, forcing Anima to conform to
the harsh conditions.
<br><br>
Balancing the schism within the universe, a black hole connected Edolas and Grynn. Voidrus rejoiced in the power struggle it perpetuated within Grynn, the
Realm of Power.
<br><br>
Inanis turned Zuria into her own whimsical daydream, bending reality around the Realm of Transmutation beyond the impossible.
<br><br>
And the twins held both realms of Darkness and Light—Kraxus and the Citadel—as harmonic opposites perpetuating the eternal war.
